# odin4

Odin4 is an open-source flash tool for Samsung devices.

### Status
This project is under active development. It currently contains bugs and unfinished parts, and some builds may fail depending on the environment.

### Help wanted
We are migrating cryptographic code to **Crypto++**, fixing build issues, and cleaning up the codebase (standardizing English comments, improving stability).

If you have experience with C/C++, libusb, Crypto++, or reverse engineering, **contributions are very welcome**.
Please check the Issues and submit a Pull Request.
