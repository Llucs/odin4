# odin4 (WIP)

Odin4 is an open-source flashing tool for Samsung devices.

## Status
This project is under active development and has undergone significant improvements.  
The cryptographic implementation has been successfully migrated to **Crypto++**, and multiple build and stability issues have been fixed.

While the project is now more stable, there may still be remaining bugs, edge cases, and environment-specific build issues.

## What's new
- Cryptographic code fully migrated to **Crypto++**
- Numerous build errors and warnings fixed
- Improved code stability and internal cleanup
- Better consistency in code and comments
- Complete migration of everything to English

## Help wanted
Even with recent improvements, community contributions are still highly appreciated.

You can help by:
- Finding and fixing remaining bugs
- Code cleanup and refactoring
- Reverse engineering improvements
- Testing on different Samsung devices and environments

If you have experience with **C/C++**, **libusb**, **Crypto++**, or reverse engineering, your contributions are very welcome.

Please check the Issues and feel free to submit a Pull Request.
